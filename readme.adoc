This cli app allows a user to quickly query wikipedia.org.

== Getting Started

=== Retrieve the Code

You can either clone the codebase or download it directly, I suggest downloading a release.

==== Cloning

. Download and install Git link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] if Git is not installed
. Choose a method of cloning using github's documentation link:https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls[here]

git clone git@github.com:BZohorskys-Web-Scraping-Repos/wikipedia.git

==== Downloading

When downloading you can either download a zip folder of a specific branch of the codebase or download a release provided on github. A link to download the master branch of the codebase can be found link:https://github.com/BZohorskys-Web-Scraping-Repos/Wikipedia/archive/refs/heads/master.zip[here]. However, I'd suggest downloading a release as those will be more stable. 

=== Setup a Virtual Environment

. Download and install Python link:https://www.python.org/downloads/[here] if Python is not installed
. Move to the project's top directory
. Create a virtual environment
. Activate the virtual environment
. Install project dependencies

[source]
----
cd <to the project's top level directory>
python3 -m venv virtualenv
source virtualenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

== Run Project

. Move to the project's top level directory
. Activate virtual environment
. Execute Code to query for a search term
. Execute Code to query for current events

.Code Snippet (Linux & MacOS)
[source]
----
cd <to the project's top level directory>
source virtualenv/bin/activate
python launcher.py <search argument>
python launcher.py --news
----

.Code Snippet (Windows)
[source]
----
cd <to the project's top level directory>
.\virtualenv\Scripts\activate.bat
python launcher.py <search argument>
python launcher.py --news

== Project Distribution

This section describes how to create a binary to distribute to others. Note, this binary will be OS dependent (Windows/Linux/MacOS) meaning only users sharing the same type of OS can share binaries.

. Move to the project's top directory
. Activate virtual environment
. Create a binary called "wiki" located in the dist directory

.Code Snippet (Linux & MacOS)
[source]
----
cd <to the project's top level directory>
source virtualenv/bin/activate
pyinstaller wiki.spec
----

.Code Snippet (Windows)
[source]
----
cd <to the project's top level directory>
.\virtualenv\Scripts\activate.bat
pyinstaller wiki.spec

== Run Binary

. Execute the binary 

.Code Snippet (Linux & MacOS)
